## Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation stage, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Data Extraction
3. Data Cleaning
4. Summary and Visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;
- What is the sum of all the sales?
- What is the yearly sales trend?
- Which coffee type is selling more?
- Which location has the highest sales?
- What is the trend of total sales per product in the past three years?
- How is the performance of the top ten customers?

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

1. The sum of all the sales across the three years is $45,134.26.
2. Across the years, 2022 is the only year that has the lowest sales record.
3. Excelsa is the most sold coffee type in the 2019 & 2020 but dropped its selling value in 2021 & 2022.
4. United states is the country with the highest sales record.
5. The coffee that has the highest overall total sales is the Excelsa.
6. The top ten customers wasn't stable over the three years.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis I recommend the following;
- Focus on expanding and promoting the Excelsa coffee type since it has the highest generated revenue.
-  There should be a doulbed improvement on the quality of services been rendered and also device effective marketing strategy.
-  Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high long time value customers effectively.
-  More data set on customer sentiment will be needed to get more insights into customer behavior and proper recommendation for the marketing team.

## Limitations

The dataset provided was limited with some information like "data on customer sentiment" which is necessary to analyze recency, frequecy and monetary value of customers. This dataset will give more insight on the customer behavior.
